# KEYBOARD CHAOS

Keyboard Chaos is a simple typing test game designed for solo play. Players can customize the word categories, difficulty levels, and modes. The available word categories are English words and Python words, while the three difficulty levels are easy, intermediate, and hard. Easy level only contains words with 3-4 characters, while hard level only contains words with more than 4 characters. Intermediate level is a mix of easy and hard words. There are two modes to choose from: word mode and time mode. In word mode, the typing test ends when time runs out, and players can set the desired time limit. In time mode, the test ends when the player has finished typing the set number of words, which they can also customize. Keyboard Chaos aims to provide a natural typing experience with real-time feedback on typing speed in words per minute and accuracy percentage, as well as alerts for typos.
